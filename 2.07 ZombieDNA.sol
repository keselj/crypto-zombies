/* First we need to make sure that _targetDna isn't longer than 16 digits.
To do this, we can set _targetDna equal to _targetDna % dnaModulus to only take the last 16 digits.

Next our function should declare a uint named newDna, and set it equal to the average of myZombie's DNA
and _targetDna (as in the example above).

Once we have the new DNA, let's call _createZombie. 
You can look at the zombiefactory.sol tab if you forget which parameters this function needs to call it.
Note that it requires a name, so let's set our new zombie's name to "NoName"
for now â€” we can write a function to change zombies' names later. */
