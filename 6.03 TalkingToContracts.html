<!--In the <head> of our document, include another script tag for cryptozombies_abi.js
 so we can import the ABI definition into our project.

At the beginning of our <script> tag in the <body>, declare a var named cryptoZombies, 
but don't set it equal to anything. Later we'll use this variable to store our instantiated contract.

Next, create a function named startApp(). We'll fill in the body in the next 2 steps.

The first thing startApp() should do is declare a var named cryptoZombiesAddress and 
set it equal to the string "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS" (this is the address of the CryptoZombies contract on mainnet).

Lastly, let's instantiate our contract. Set cryptoZombies equal to a new web3js.eth.Contract 
like we did in the example code above. (Using cryptoZombiesABI, which gets imported with our script tag, 
and cryptoZombiesAddress from above). -->
