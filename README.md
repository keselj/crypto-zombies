Crypto Zombies is an interactive tutorial that helps you learn Solidity, the programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It takes you through the process of building your own crypto-collectibles game, where you can create, own, and trade unique digital assets called "zombies."

This repository contains the complete source code and assets for the Crypto Zombies tutorial. Each lesson has its own branch, allowing you to easily navigate and explore the codebase at different stages of the tutorial.
