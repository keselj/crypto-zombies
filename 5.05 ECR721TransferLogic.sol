/* Define a function named _transfer. It will take 3 arguments, address _from,
address _to, and uint256 _tokenId. It should be a private function.

We have 2 mappings that will change when ownership changes: ownerZombieCount
(which keeps track of how many zombies an owner has) and zombieToOwner (which keeps track of who owns what).

The first thing our function should do is increment ownerZombieCount 
for the person receiving the zombie (address _to). Use ++ to increment.

Next, we'll need to decrease the ownerZombieCount 
for the person sending the zombie (address _from). Use -- to decrement.

Lastly, we'll want to change zombieToOwner mapping for this _tokenId so it now points to _to.

I lied, that wasn't the last step. There's one more thing we should do.

The ERC721 spec includes a Transfer event. 
The last line of this function should fire Transfer with the correct information â€” check erc721.sol 
to see what arguments it's expecting to be called with and implement it here. */
